title: vertical slices transition effect
---
Probably about 20 years ago at this point I had a coding error in whatever I was trying to do and got an effect I thought would be really interesting in itself.  I made a note with the intention of revisiting and writing something deliberate in there style but never did. 

Cut the screen into ~20 vertical slices, and time shift each of these randomly, and then scrunch up the vertical coordinate in an oscillating function (I'm thinking sinc) and grey out the out-of-bounds region and slide the frequency and phase randomly, and then resettle these at new position revealing a new image.
