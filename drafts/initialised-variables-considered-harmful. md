title: Initialised variables considered harmful
---
Suppose you have a variable `x`.

```c++
int x;
```

Hello `x`.

Now suppose you decide that under some circumstances `x` should have a particular value.

```c++
if (some_circumstances) x = particular_value;
```

And later on `x`'s good buddy `y` wants to have it's own value based on`x`'s value. 

```c++
int y = f(x);
```

Hey `y`.  How's it going? 

What's that, `y`?  You don't feel so good?  You think your might be coming down with Undefined Behaviour?  Oh no!  What's that coming out of your nose, `y`?  Is that a nasal demon?!  `y`, aye you _time traveling_ right now?  Stop that at once!

\* chaos ensues \*

Narrator: No need to panic, humble viewer.  This was just a simulation of what _could_ happen if you forget to initialise your variables.  Remember: always initialise your variables!
