Extra built-in operators:
* atan2() function ( (x,y) -> angle )
* min/max

Custom blocks should be able to return values.

Bucket/list-like AND and OR blocks, rather than having to stack up
pairwise.  Maybe graphically rendered, with serial or parallel
connections.  Sums, too.  And right-click "negate" option on variables.

Built in "spread" effect, like scale, but origins of unconnected pieces
move without themselves changing size (useful for particle effects and
explosions and stuff like that).

Variables should be presented in container boxes, representing scope
(global, local), where you can drag them from one container to another.

Different blocks for "with screen refresh", rather than this arcane
checkbox you only see at creation.

Double-click on function blocks to go to where they're defined.  Maybe
variables too (where there's a set-var-to).

Also:
* diff-ability and revision control
* obviously lots more sprite/clone finding
* queries and iterable filters?
