Extra built-in operators:
* atan2() function ( (x,y) -> angle )
* min/max

Custom blocks should be able to return values.

Built in "spread" effect, like scale, but origins of unconnected pieces
move without themselves changing size (useful for particle effects and
explosions and stuff like that).

Variables should be presented in container boxes, representing scope
(global, local), where you can drag them from one container to another.

Different blocks for "with screen refresh", rather than this arcane
checkbox you only see at creation.

Also:
* diff-ability and revision control
* obviously lots more sprite/clone finding
* queries and iterable filters?
