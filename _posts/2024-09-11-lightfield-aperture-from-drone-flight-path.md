title: Light field aperture synthesis from drone flight path
---
For a low-rate-of-change scene like a construction site, I think it
should be possible to use a drone with a camera on it to repeatedly fly
through the same grid pattern in the sky, where that grid represents a
large aperture, collecting compound images as if it were a light-field
camera.

Repeating the flight path over and over means getting multiple frames for a
time lapse video.

Then you could reproject that time-lapse video in miniature, viewed from
various angles through that aperture and with DOF effects, like you're
some kind of giant watching ants build a stadium or office block.

Just a thought.
