{% include svg.html %}

My own contribution to the field of making up improbable alien number systems
involves counting in base 210.  Rather than try to define 210 distinct symbols,
or to make a 14-upon-15 or 15-upon-14 digit pair system, I chose to break each
digit down into three components mod 5, mod 6, and mod 7.

Mod 6 is the fusion of mod 2 and mod 3 to try to make things a little less
unwieldy.

This means that when counting in ones, all three components change, but they
wrap around at different points, and you can derive the overall magnitude via
[Chinese Remainder Theorem][].

It also implies that you can determine, at a glance, the remainder of a value
divided by 2, 3, 5, and 7.

That was the design spec I gave myself, anyway.  In terms of making up glyphs
there's way too much freedom to settle on anything easily.  After faffing about
for a bit I came up with these segments of digits:

Where absense of a feature (a ring, or an arc, or a bend in the line)
represents a lack of remainder, so that I needed fewer variations on the
feature for the other cases, and so they could be a little more distinct from
each other.

I think there were a couple of sub-patterns I had in mind when I assigned these
to different remainders, but I don't recall what they all were.  This is an
exercise for the reader.

This gives me the following skeleton:

<svg width="100%" height="850" viewbox="0 0 800 850">
  {%- for i in (0..15) -%}
  <text x="{{i | times: 50 | plus: 70}}" y="10">+{{i}}</text>
  {%- endfor -%}
  {%- for i in (0..13) -%}
  <text x="25" y="{{i | times: 60 | plus: 40}}" text-anchor="end">{{i|times:15}}</text>
  {%- endfor -%}

  {%- for i in (0..209) -%}
  <use x="{{i | modulo: 15 | times: 50 | plus: 70}}"
       y="{{i | divided_by: 15 | times: 60 | plus: 40}}"
       href="#digit_{{i}}" />
  <text x="{{i | modulo: 15 | times: 50 | plus: 70}}"
        y="{{i | divided_by: 15 | times: 60 | plus: 65}}"
        font-size="50%"
  > {{i}}={{i | modulo: 5}}:{{i | modulo: 6}}:{{i | modulo: 7}} </text>
  {%- endfor -%}
</svg>

What I would do next, if I were satisfied with that skeletion, is to
re-approximate these as, for example, pen strokes (or brush strokes, or toenail
clipping arrangements, or however this alien would choose to make the markings
of their writing system) to make them look more organic and also more visually
distinct.  Adding the skew of a left or right handed stroke, for example, in
order to make notionally-mirrored digits more distinct from each other.

But I'm _not_ satisfied with this skeleton.  I think that maybe I can encode
more clues as to the underlying number theory in the relations between the
segments and the other segments with which they fuse.

Can a human learn 210 distinct digits and use their properties as leverage into
other arithmetic?  I don't know.  It sounds implausible, but I think perhaps if
one had grown up with it it might not be quite such a ridiculous idea.
