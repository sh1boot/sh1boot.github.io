Yesterday I was reminded of the occasion on which I first learned about
spinach having not as much iron as commonly believed, and that the idea
came down to a transcription error.  I wasn't really confident in my
recollection so I went and looked it up and fell into reading about
"[Academic urban legends][]".

It's a wild ride.  So many twists and turns.  Read the whole thing
before continuing here because spoilers follow.  Read the whole thing
even though I'm about to say how unsatisfying the conclusion is.

Now the original article is written on the topic of the quality of
academic citations, as promised in the abstract, but I'm here to talk
about spinach.

For me the story left too many questions unanswered.  Some easy to
resolve (spinach's iron content is high-middling in its class, and the
science has been broadly stable on this for well over a century), but
where did spinach's special status in popular understanding really come
from if not the origins we now take to be "debunked"?

After finding the original story's [main reference][Sutton, 2010b] for
declaring closure on the matter I was even _more_ dissatisfied.  I tried
plugging the names of the scientists mentioned into Google, and I found
discussion on the matter by a JL Dagg offering suggestions as to where
[pieces of the misplaced decimal story might have come from][Dagg,
2015].

I can't help but imagine all this as a long chain of pedantic
one-upmanship.

But of course none of this really matters, because iron in spinach is in
the wrong form for effective absorption, and because spinach contains
[oxalates][].

> Well actually...

Dagg's tone and approach appeals to me.  Rather than asking "is this
true?", which is a question I see as ultimately unhelpful and misleading
given the fractal nature of nuance and context, they ask "why do they
believe this?".

Is Dagg's hypothesis right?  There's no knowing that, but maybe I'll
just assume or pretend it's right because I can't do any better.  All
knowledge is provisional, after all (with apologies to Karl Popper).

But this still doesn't answer my original question.

#### What was the question again?

Why do people believe that spinach is a good source of iron?

[Dagg suggests][Dagg, 2017] a conflation of symptoms and remedies
relating to tuberculosis and anaemia.

But a much deeper dive into the matter is '[Spinach in Blunderland][]',
wherein we learn ... _a lot!_  Everything that went before is,
comparatively, a very narrow and distorted view on a much broader
picture.

I can't possibly summarise it all, but one thing that stands out to me
in this narrative is the reappearance of Gustav von Bunge.  In this
context Bunge's research appears to _debunk_ earlier, unreasonably high
figures but, importantly, the matter goes viral with the effect of
drawing public attention to the still-relatively-high iron content in
Bunge's results.  The values aren't _exceptionally_ high by modern
estimates, but high enough to cause a wave of misplaced enthusiasm
around the world.

It seems that the resulting public over-enthusiasm had been called out a
few times subsequently, but virality had not been attained until Hamblin
got the matter into BMJ in 1981 and people started digging in to the
origin of the resulting citations.

Unfortunately the subsequent focus has been on falsifying a specific error
at a specific point in a specific line of communication in order
to produce a debunked myth, without due regard to the greater network
of errors and miscommunications which produced the outcome; and in
order to achieve that great debunk a lot of truths were overlooked.

Despite all that there's still a final possibility: that the popular
belief about spinach having high iron content exists simply because it's
basically true.  It isn't the best, but among commonly recognised and
available plant sources it seems to still rate fairly highly (with
caveats and exceptions).  Maybe people don't mean anything more than
that when they repeat "the myth" that spinach is "high in iron".
