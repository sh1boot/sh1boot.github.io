title:  Running all cells of a battery completely flat
---
I feel like it shouldn't be impossible for electronics to run their batteries
completely flat before malfunctioning, and to be able to support a mixture of
different battery conditions without risk of leaks or explosions.

Serialising batteries in order to get a desired voltage is kind of old
fashioned, and also the situation that requires that you approximately match
the condition and technology of individual cells in the stack.
