title: A light filed aperture synthesized from a drone flight path
---
For a low-rate-of-change scene like a construction site, I think it should be possible to use a drone with a camera on it to repeatedly fly a grid of a large aperture collecting images as if it were a light-field camera.  repeating the flight path over and over to collect multiple frames of a time lapse video. 

Then you could reproject that time-lapse video in miniature, viewed from various angles and with DOF effects.
