title: A light field aperture synthesized from a drone flight path
---
For a low-rate-of-change scene like a construction site, I think it should be
possible to use a drone with a camera on it to repeatedly fly through the same
grid pattern in the sky, where that grid represents a large lightfield
aperture, collecting compound images as if it were a light-field camera.
Repeating the flight path over and over means getting multiple frames for a
time lapse video.

Then you could reproject that time-lapse video in miniature, viewed from
various angles through that aperture and with DOF effects.
