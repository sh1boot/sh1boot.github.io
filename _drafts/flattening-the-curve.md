title: Flattening the curve of viral misinformation
---
Something that stands out to me about a lot of social media is that if
you take a day or two to think about something before posting a comment,
or if you go and spend time gathering facts and checking references and
informing yourself before circling back to the discussion, the exposure
of such comments is much lower than if you blurt out a half-baked hot
take right away while the post is still hot.

Social media promotes shallow, uninformed thought.

You may have noticed the impact this has had on society.

So I was wondering if there was some way to time-shift the exposure of
content, such that it's exposed to some groups early and to others later
on.

Does it matter who gets first look in?  Or should it be randomised?

It's tempting to think that those who have a habit of adding commentary
with references (those so-called "Community Notes" or other material in
that style) should have first dibs so that those who come by later at
least have access to a fuller picture... but that surely leads to
perverse incentives.  Perhaps that metric but filtered by a quality
rating distilled from community votes could make things less perverse?

Not that it matters.  Slowing things down and giving people space to
think before they blurt out stupid crap is definitely going to reduce
engagement and lessen ad revenue.  That's a financially irresponsible
thing to do to your shareholders.  Thanks, Capitalism!
