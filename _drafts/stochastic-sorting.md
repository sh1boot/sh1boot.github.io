title: stochastically ordering items by frequency
---

if you believe your sure data will fit a curve, then, like stochastic counters which conditionally increment based on a probability suitable to the conditions, you can perform stochastic swaps to conditionally promote items up the list based on a probability.  including, I guess, a flat probability.
