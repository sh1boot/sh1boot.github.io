title: finding stuff using AR and AI
---

If AI can do a better-than-human job of picking up things like keys and glasses in a video (ideally compositing multiple frames for better resolution), then it would be a very handy thing to have AR glasses highlighting these when asked.

Better still if it could search for text and point to the box with that label.  If it's a serial number (or a barcode) that's something humans especially suck at.
